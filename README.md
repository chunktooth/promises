#### In additions:

- ```.then()``` returns a response object which is a resolved promise from a successful fetch, whereas ```.catch()``` handles & returns an error if something goes wrong with the request or when a promise is rejected.

- ```Promises``` are the core of JavaScript asynchronous programming, allowing multiple executions even while awaiting responses, such as when fetching API from a remote serverrr.

- Example of functions that use Promises are ```async await```, ```setTimeout```. Promises are also used in JS libraries such as Q, when, WinJS, RSVP.js
