#### In additions:

- .then() resolves a promise from a previous successful fetch, then returns a response object, whereas .catch() handles & returns an error if something goes wrong with the request.

- Promises are the core of JavaScript asynchronous programming, allowing multiple executions even while awaiting responses, such as when fetching API from a remote serverrr.

- Example of functions that use Promises are Async-await, setTimeout. Promises are also used in JS libraries such as Q, when, WinJS, RSVP.js
